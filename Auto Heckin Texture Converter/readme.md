# Auto Heckin' Texture Converter

Automatically converts any texture file(s) to the TGA format required by the game, eliminating the need of using Nvidia's tool to convert to BC1a and then DivinityMashine manually.

**Note:** The bash script will currently crash due to an issue with running DivinityMashine through Wine. The issue is being looked into.

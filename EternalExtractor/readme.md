# EternalExtractor

Shell script to automatically extract all Doom Eternal's .resources files using QuickBMS or Powerball523's EternalREsourceExtractor.

## Instructions for EternalResourceExtractor (recommended)

Simply download the latest binary from the tool's [release page](https://github.com/PowerBall253/EternalResourceExtractor), and linoodle from the [EternalBins folder](https://github.com/leveste/EternalBasher/blob/master/EternalBins/liblinoodle.so), and copy `oo2core_8_win64.dll` from your game's directory to your extractor directory.

**Note:** Do not download the ".exe" binary as that one is intended for Windows and won't work with this script.

## Instructions for QuickBMS with WINE

You can download the [Windows version of QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) (first link). Simply extract the files from the zip and, when prompted by the script, add the full path to the folder containing **quickbms_4gb_files.exe**
